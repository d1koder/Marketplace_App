## R7 | Identify the Problem. 

Covid-19 has produced new and unique problems that have affected the global economy in an unprecedented scale. One in particular - out of the many indusrtires that've been affected, is the hospitalty industry. Resturants all over have closed or are restricted. What once was a fun endeavour, has and is slowly losing its appeal. 

Hospitality workers, especailly chefs have lost jobs. 

Consumers have also lost an importnant factor that plays in their work/life balance - entertainment by food. limited  choices have degraded consumer confidence as they now choose to just confide in thier own abode. 

## R8 | The Solution.

Cookd is a marketplace style web app that aims to bridge this forced gap in the market by connecting proffesional/ highly experienced chefs with home owners/ renters. 

Users looking to host a party, can order a professional chef to come into their home and take care of the whole restaurant experience, but in the comfort of their own home . 

The vision for this app was inspired by conveinace. 

Chefs have jobs again - or moreso their own buisness (sidehusltle if you will?)

Eager consumers now have a means to satisfy their entertainment itch.
